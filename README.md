# Project title: Objects Detection from images
## Data set: https://cocodataset.org/
## Project idea:
The project aims to develop a robust object recognition system capable of identifying and classifying objects within images using machine learning techniques. The core objective is to leverage advanced image processing algorithms and deep learning models to accurately detect and label various objects, such as vehicles, animals, or everyday items, in diverse image datasets. This system will be designed to handle a wide range of object types and conditions, providing a scalable solution for applications in automated surveillance, image tagging, and real-time object tracking.
To achieve this, the project will involve training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on large-scale image datasets. The system will be evaluated based on its precision, recall, and overall accuracy in object classification. Additionally, performance metrics will be analyzed to ensure the model’s effectiveness across different environments and object categories. The project will also explore techniques to optimize the model’s performance and address challenges such as occlusion, varying lighting conditions, and object size variations.
